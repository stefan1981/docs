# random commands
Getting the size of all files and folders inside the current directory can be done by typing:
```
Â ls | xargs du -s -BM
```

Get filesize in descending order from all files in a recursive folder structure
```
find . -type f -exec du -a -h --max-depth=100 {} + | sort -hr
```

Another quite handy tool is ncdu. It provides you the disc usage in a graphical way on the shell. Install it like this:
```
sudo apt-get install ncdu
```

List folders bigger 1Mb and list them in descending order
```
du -sm * | awk '$1 > 1' | sort -n -r
```

List the ten largest folders inside a recursive folder structure
```
find . -type d -print0 | xargs -0 du | sort -n | tail -10 | cut -f2 | xargs -I{} du -sh {}
```

## perform action on multiple files
In reality you have quite often perform a certain command on several files. First i detect all files I'm looking for and store them in a filelist.

```
find . -name "myFilename" > filelist.txt
```

Second i run through this file, line by line and perform my command on all filename I've received one step before.

```
while read -r LINE; do echo "$LINE"; done < filelist.txt
```

You need to replace in several files. You can do it with sed. Be aware about masking special chars. In the example below the string "my\folder" is replaced with "your\folder".
Replacing with sed works like this: sed -i s#old#new#g
The delimiter (in this case the #) can be changed. The first sign after the s acts as delimiter.

```
while read -r LINE; do
sed -i s#\"my\/folder\",\"your\/folder\"#g "$LINE";
done < filenames.txt
```
